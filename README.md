# Customer-Segmentation-Analytics-

Implementing a data visualization interface in Python using Plotly Dash. 

In this project, I wanted to look at how purchase patterns are different for various customer demographics (mainly based on gender and customer income). This is helpful for various small marketing firms to further understand their customers and what they prefer when they go shopping. 

**to run the program and open the application on a local port**: 

1. Install Dash and Pandas (version 2.8.1 for Dash) 
2. Run 'python3 app.py' in a local terminal and open the resulting link on a browser.
